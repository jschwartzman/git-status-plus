# git-status-plus
This is a Qt Python program that will find all of the git repositories on your disk(s) and indicate their git status. The first git status program was a shell script that needed to know in advance the git repositories you wanted to manage. git-status-plus will automatically find your git repositories and indicate their status on a file by file basis. 

GitStatusDialog.ui was generated by Qt 5 Designer and is an xml description of the dialog and of the objects contained in the dialog. The command pyuic5 -x -o gitStatus.py GitStatusDialog.ui is used to create gitStatus.py.

The seach for git repositories can be limited or expanded by placing gitStatus.ini in the startup directory of gitStatus.py. If you start up gitStatus.py without gitStatus.ini, a default .ini file will be created that includes your HOME directory.
