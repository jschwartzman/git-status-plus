# git-status-plus
This is a Qt (Python or C++) program that will find all of the git repositories on your disk(s) and indicate their git status. The first git status program was a shell script that needed to know in advance the git repositories you wanted to manage. git-status-plus will automatically find your git repositories and indicate their status on a file by file basis.
